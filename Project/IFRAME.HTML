Review and compare faculty experience for your specific subject (for example, Python, Big Data, Android) since different trainers may handle different modules.


If you’re looking for advanced topics (e.g., machine learning, deep AI) verify that the curriculum is up-to-date.


Since you’re preparing for NIMCET 2024 and are interested in web accessibility/ARIA, check if the institute offers modules aligned with web dev and accessibility standards (since many courses appear oriented to general software dev rather than niche areas).


Summary paragraph
Royal Technosoft Pvt Ltd in Ahmedabad is a well-situated training and software-services institute offering a broad range of IT-oriented courses and development support. With live-project training, certification options, a classroom plus online learning environment, and a track record of software-development work, it serves both students entering IT and professionals upskilling. If you are seeking to build practical skills in programming, web/mobile dev or data technologies, it represents a viable option — provided you check the fit of the specific course to your goals (for example, web accessibility or NIMCET-related skills) and clarify the placement or certification outcomes.
If you like, I can check recent student reviews, fee details for their specific courses, or compare with a few similar institutes in Ahmedabad — would you like that?
